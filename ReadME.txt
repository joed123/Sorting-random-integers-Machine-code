This program gets a user input in the range [min = 15 .. max = 200] then 
generates a request random integers in the range [lo = 100 .. hi = 999], storing them in consecutive elements of an array.
Then displays the list of integers before sorting, 10 numbers per line. Then
sorts the list in descending order.
Then calculates the median value, rounded to the nearest integer.
